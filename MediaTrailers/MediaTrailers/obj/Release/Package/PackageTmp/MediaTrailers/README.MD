# Movie Trailer Page

A website containing trailers to all of my favorite movies and tv-shows.

Features:
 * Adding a new movie will automatically pull its info from IMDB
 * The trailer is automatically scraped from Youtube

## Start Here

1. Begin by downloading all of the files
2. Ensure that you have flask installed
3. There must be a fresh_tomatoes.html file (if not, just create an empty file with that name)

## To Run:

1. Type "python main.py" in the terminal
2. Load up the browser and navigate to "localhost:5000"
3. You can add media through the "Add movies" button
